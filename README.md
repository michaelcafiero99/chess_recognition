# Chess Recognition 

## Description

This project is a chess analytics tool which integrates Stockfish (the leading chess engine) and several layers of computer vision. The program can recognize a chess board anywhere on the screen, and from there identifies the pieces and their coordinates. The coordinates are then submitted to the stockfish API to receive the correct move in any position. In the future, this project may be published as an app or chrome extension, or the model could be retrained for over-the-board use.
